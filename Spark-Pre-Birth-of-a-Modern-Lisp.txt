Spark - Pre-Birth of a Modern Lisp
==================================

Introduction
------------

Spark is a Modern dialect of Lisp currently being planned. This document is
not a formal functional (much less technical) specification for it, but rather
a briandump of some of the conclusions I (= Shlomi Fish) have reached
about the fundamentals of its behaviour. Nevertheless, some preliminary
(and still subject to change) specification of it will be given and some
code examples will brought.

Besides contemporary Lisp dialects such as Common Lisp, Scheme and Arc, Spark
draws a lot of inspiration from other modern languages, paradigms, and
technologies including Perl 5, Perl 6, Python, Ruby, Java and Haskell.
